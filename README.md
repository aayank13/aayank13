<p>I am a software engineer passionate about bridging the gap between systems programming and artificial intelligence — building efficient, scalable, and intelligent systems from the ground up. My work spans backend architecture, frontend engineering, and deep learning research.</p>
<p>I currently work at a startup where I built a production-grade AI voice agent using Deepgram&apos;s STT and TTS APIs, reducing operational costs by 65% and improving latency by 40%. I focus on architecting reliable backends with <strong> FastAPI</strong> and crafting modern, interactive frontends with <strong> Next.js</strong>, ensuring both performance and seamless user experience.</p>
<p>At the <strong>Software Development Cell, GGSIPU</strong>, I lead backend development and system design for university-scale platforms used by thousands of students. My work involves designing scalable APIs, managing databases, and deploying secure infrastructure on VPS environments.</p>
<p>Beyond web systems, I actively explore the intersection of<!-- --> <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>deep learning</strong>, and <strong>natural language processing</strong>. I experiment with <strong>large language models</strong>, reinforcement learning, and multimodal architectures, constantly pushing my understanding of how intelligence can emerge from computation.</p>
<p>I'm deeply passionate about <strong>Rust</strong> and systems programming — fascinated by its blend of performance and safety. I use it to understand how low-level design impacts scalability, performance, and the developer experience itself.</p>
<p>I love dissecting complex ideas — whether it's a neural architecture or a compiler optimization — and translating them into real, working systems. I continuously share my insights and learning journeys across my website and socials, driven by the belief that engineering is a lifelong process of curiosity and creation.</p>
